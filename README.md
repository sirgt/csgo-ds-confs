## Why? 
Because I'm Lazy and don't want to google all how to do this again.

# How? 
First of all you have to do a [normal](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Counter-Strike:_Global_Offensive_Dedicated_Servers) installation of your CSGO dedicated server then;

This repo have the following files that goes inside the configuration 
```
~/csgo/gamemodes_server.txt
~/csgo/mapcycle.txt
~/csgo/maplist.txt
~/csgo/cfg/autoexec.cfg
```
and a bash script to lauch the server
```
~/launch-csgo-ds.sh
```

# Game Launch

```
